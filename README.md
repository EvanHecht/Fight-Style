# Fight-Style
Fight Style is a fighting game I made that is best described as a mix between League of Legends &amp; Super Smash Bros. It features (only) local versus. The goal of the game is to KO the other player 3 times either by getting them to %500 or by filling up your kill bar and landing your fourth ability once it is filled. Everything except the sound and music was soley developed by me (Evan Hecht).
